0.20    Unknown
  - Fix accidentally marking containers as prepared when they are not

0.19    Unknown
  - Component: Add class attribute
  - ComponentList: Add each and find

0.18    Unknown
  - Add ComponentList and use it to keep container components.
  - Container: find_component now returns the component's index, not the
    component.

0.17    Unknown
  - Useless whitespace changes

  - Insets: ad as_array

0.16    Unknown
  - Opps, I forgot. :(

0.15    Unknown
  - Add prepared flag to components.  Attributes that affect rendering have
    been modified to set prepared to 0 via a trigger.  Any new attributes
    added henceforth should do the same.
  - Containers (being Components) also have a prepared flag, but it is set
    to true by the layout manager, not by the container itself.  Also, a
    container is not prepared unless all of it's child components are
    prepared.  See Layout::Manager for more details.
  - TextBox: Fix bug when prepared & packed with text attribute set
  - POD


0.14    Unknown

  - Component: explicitly return from outside_width and outside_height
  - Component: if minimum width or height are set already, don't change them
    in prepare
  - Font: add derive

0.13    Unknown
  - Reorganize prepare/pack/draw API to be handled by the Driver
  - Add _resize and _finish_page to Driver API
  - Component: Add page attribute
  - Driver: Don't check class of incoming component before asking if it has
    components and treating it like a container.

0.12    Unknown
  - Path: Add curve_to and rel_curve_to

0.11    Unknown
  - Small optimizations
  - Driver: add reset
  - Textbox: Add angle
  - Use Forest rather than Tree::Simple per stevan's request

0.10    Unknown
  - Path: add rectangle
  - New feature & hint: Add "preserve" to Operation.  Setting this causes
    the canvas to NOT clear the current path on a do().  This operation can
    then be used as a hint to the driver to not create a new path, but to
    reuse the old one.

0.09    Unknown
  - Path: add arc, close_path, get_path
  - Path: rename get_primitive_at to get_primitive
  - Path: rename count_primitives to primitive_count
  - Path: clone points rather than using them, they tend to change
  - Path: don't inherit or implement anything out of Geo::Primitive, it's
    not necessary
  - Path: add hints attr with for driver hinting and add contiguous flag for
    use with same
  - Gradient: add line attr for guiding Gradient
  - Canvas: update path proxy methods
  - Make everything cloneable, adding Clone trait to 'deep' clone attrs

0.08    Unknown
  - Path: default starting point to 0,0

  - Brush: Add Color
  - Add Canvas calls to Driver
  - Add Operation::Fill and Operation::Stroke
  - Lots of POD
  - Add Paint and children

  - Add disclaimer
  - Add lines to Textbox and chop up input, this is likely temporary
  - Add optional layout manager to container
  - prepare now expects the driver to be passed in
  - Component's prepare sets minimum sizes to the outside ones
  - Return default font size from coderef
  - Use isa to check component classes and put container at the bottom
    so that the parent container is drawn before it's children.
  - Add get_tree method to component for visualizing the entire component
  - Prepare children before parents
  - Don't return inside_height or width < 0
